<h2>Income Prediction Model</h2>
This project focuses on developing a prediction model to estimate the income of individuals using Random Forest, XGBoost algorithms. The dataset used in this project contains various features such as age, education level, occupation, work experience, and more, along with corresponding income labels.

<h2>Dataset</h2>
The dataset used for this project consists of information about individuals, including their demographics, education, occupation, and other relevant attributes. Each individual's income level is also provided in the dataset. It is important to note that the dataset may contain missing values, which need to be addressed during the data preprocessing phase.

<h2>Data Preprocessing</h2>
To prepare the data for modeling, several preprocessing techniques were applied to handle missing values and perform feature engineering. The following steps were taken:

Missing Value Imputation: Missing values in the dataset were addressed using appropriate techniques such as mean imputation or using regression models to predict missing values based on other features.

Feature Scaling: Feature scaling was applied to ensure that all features are on a similar scale, preventing any particular feature from dominating others. Techniques such as Min-Max scaling or Standardization were utilized to scale the features.

Normalization: Normalization techniques were employed to rescale the features to a range between 0 and 1. This step was particularly useful when dealing with features that had different scales and units.

<h2>Model Building</h2>
Three regression algorithms were implemented to predict individual incomes: Random Forest, XGBoost, and Extra Tree regressor. These algorithms were selected based on their ability to handle complex datasets and provide accurate predictions.

Random Forest Regressor: The Random Forest algorithm constructs multiple decision trees and combines their predictions to obtain the final prediction. It is known for its robustness against overfitting and its capability to capture intricate relationships between features and the target variable. In this project, the Random Forest Regressor achieved the highest R2 score, indicating a good fit to the data.

XGBoost: XGBoost is an optimized implementation of gradient boosting, which creates a powerful predictive model by combining the predictions of multiple weak models (decision trees). XGBoost is renowned for its speed and high performance on diverse datasets.

<h2>Evaluation</h2>
The performance of each model was evaluated using the R2 score, which measures the proportion of variance in the target variable that can be predicted from the features. The Random Forest Regressor exhibited the highest R2 score among the models, indicating its effectiveness in predicting individual incomes.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
In conclusion, this project developed a prediction model using Random Forest, XGBoost, and Extra Tree regressor algorithms to estimate individual incomes based on various features. The Random Forest Regressor achieved the highest R2 score, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing the complex relationships between the features and the target variable.
